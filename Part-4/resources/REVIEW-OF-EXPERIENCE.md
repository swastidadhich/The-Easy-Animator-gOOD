<h1>Review of Our Experience</h1>
This experience was an interesting one and made us reflect on the design choices we have made in 
these past couple of assignments. We thought that this assignment was definitely challenging since 
we were trying to integrate our code together yet make sure that our code would independently work. 
After reviewing our provider’s code, we learned a lot about the advantages of using an MVVM design 
as opposed to our MVC design and would definitely consider using their MVVM approach if redoing this 
assignment, given its advantages of a looser coupling and easier testing. Our provider’s code also 
had a really nice user interface display with checkboxes and sliders that we would also consider 
given a redo in order to elevate the appearance and intuitiveness of our user interface. Our 
providers were prompt and provided us with clarification when we needed it and it was really easy to
communicate with them. We did not have to make any changes for our customers and we made sure to 
provide our code to the team as soon as we got Professor Shesh’s email.
